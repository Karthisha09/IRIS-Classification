# Iris Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species using the famous Iris dataset. The primary goal is to build and evaluate a classification model that can predict the species of an iris based on its features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It includes measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers, representing three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the Iris dataset (e.g., CSV or Excel file).
- `notebooks/`: Colab Notebooks for Source code of the machine learning model, data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
